#### Introduction
The project is based on Github: [arielf/weight-loss](https://github.com/arielf/weight-loss), with modifications made to the data collection method and the training model to implement privacy-preserving federated learning. Additionally, IoT sensors are integrated to gather user physiological data. The original model for diet-weight correlation computation is expanded to include various applications such as diverse chart presentations and user meal suggestions on delivery platforms. The aim is to establish a collaborative, privacy-preserving, and comprehensive dietary health consultation platform.

This is the implementation code co-created by me and two classmates during our university (in NSYSU) project research.  
It combines federated learning and homomorphic encryption algorithms to create a dietary consultation system.
