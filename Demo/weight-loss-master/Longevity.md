Longevity: Lifestyle factors
============================

### _The following is a collection of factors affecting longevity_

What better source you can have for learning what leads to a longer
life, than asking the longest living people themselves?

My main source in the [wikipedia page about verified longest living people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_the_verified_oldest_people)

In their own opinions/words.

#### [Jeanne Calment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeanne_Calment) (122 years, 164 days)

Calment ascribed her longevity and relatively youthful appearance
for her age to a diet rich in *olive oil* (which she also rubbed
onto her skin), as well as a diet of port wine, and ate nearly one
kilogram (2.2 lb) of chocolate every week. She also credited her
calmness, saying, "That's why they call me Calment." Calment
reportedly remained mentally intact until her very end.

#### [Sarah Knauss](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sarah_Knauss) (119 years, 97 days)

Her daughter, Kathryn Sullivan, aged 96 at the time, opined that
Knauss is "a very tranquil person and nothing fazes her."

#### [Misao Okawa](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misao_Okawa) (117 years, 27 days)

Okawa said that "sushi and *sleep*" were the reasons why she lived so long.


#### [Maria Capovilla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mar%C3%ADa_Capovilla) (116 years 347 days)

She never smoked or drank hard liquor.

#### [Susannah Mushatt Jones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Susannah_Mushatt_Jones) (116 years and 311 days)

She only took high-blood pressure medication and a multivitamin.
Jones never smoked or consumed alcohol. She *slept about ten
hours a night* and napped throughout the day. For breakfast, she
always ate four strips of bacon along with *scrambled eggs* and
grits. She also ate bacon throughout the day.


#### [Emma Morano](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Morano) (116 years, 277 days)
When asked about the secret of her longevity, she said that she had
never used drugs, eats *three eggs a day*, drinks a glass of homemade
brandy, and enjoys a chocolate sometimes, but, above all, she thinks
positively about the future.

Elsewhere: Morano credits her long life to her diet of raw eggs
and being single.


#### [Gertrude Weaver](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gertrude_Weaver) (116 years, 276 days)
Weaver told the Associated Press that there were three factors that
have contributed to her longevity: "Trusting in the Lord, hard work
and loving everybody." Weaver added a fourth factor when she
told Time magazine that trying to do your best is another factor
adding: "Just do what you can, and if we can't, we can't"
or, in other words, "Kindness"

#### [Besse Cooper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Besse_Cooper) (116 years, 100 days)

Cooper reportedly attributed her longevity to "minding her own business"
and *avoiding junk food.*


#### [Jeralean Talley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeralean_Talley) (116 years, 25 days)

She lived by the Golden Rule: "Treat others the way you want to
be treated". She was known in the community for her wisdom and
wit, she had sometimes been asked for advice. She had previously
advised people to use common sense, saying "I don't have
much education but what little sense I got, I try to use it."


#### Coincidence?

I find it fascinating that so many of my own discoveries of
factors affecting weight-loss have also to do with longevity.

Being calm (and reducing stress) seems to be an important
factor I appear to have missed. Could it be hidden in
the "stayhome" feature?

Chocolate appears twice above, I wonder which type of chocolate
because bittersweet/dark chocolate typically has much less sugar than
milk chocolate.
